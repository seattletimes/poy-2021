            MARCH 17 | Barbara Hoffman, a community health program manager and registered nurse, taps bubbles out of a syringe filled
            with COVID-19 vaccine as teachers and others from the North Kitsap School District line up in their cars in the parking garage at the
            Suquamish Clearwater Casino Resort in Suquamish, waiting to be vaccinated. The clinic, run by the Suquamish Tribe, was set up to help
            speed teacher-vaccination efforts. When the vaccine was first available, and for a long time afterward, many people wanting to get vaccinated
            had trouble getting their dose.

            <p>YEAR TWO OF THE PANDEMIC.</p>
            <p>Let’s call it The Year of the Needle.</p>
            <div class="story-flex">
              <div class="left">
                <p>And all the hope, and contention, that came with it.</p>
                <p>Besides injections, this year the pandemic brought overrun ICUs, long-awaited reunions and miraculous recoveries.</p>
                <p>Seattle Times photographers also covered protests and politics, homelessness, a record heat wave, floods, snowstorms and one of the more unusual sports years in memory. Leavening all of that, fortunately, were exceptional moments of everyday lives. (Oh, and there’s the circumstance of a certain cat that might be the picture of how many of us feel.)</p>

                <p>The safety of our photographers, and the people they photograph, is our first priority. Like most of us, the photographers and videographers of The Seattle Times have found ways to work around the hazards of the virus. They’re masked. They’re vaxxed. They’ve had countless COVID-19 tests up their nostrils. So far, so good. Not one of our visual journalists has gotten sick. Once again, “Knock on wood.”</p>
                <p>And, once again, they’ve done really good work.</p>
                <p>This annual feature of Pacific NW magazine, and our readers’ response to it, reminds those of us on the visual team of the extraordinary responsibility and good fortune we have to be the eyes of this news organization. It motivates us. It unifies us. It humbles us.</p>
                <p>Thank you.</p>
                <p>And, please, be careful out there!</p>
